A TODO list web application that backed by Stor.IO.  Stor.IO provides an appStorage object that mirrors the localStorage API.  Items set on appStorage are stored transparently to Stor.IO.

You can [read more about Stor.IO here](http://blog.sourcebender.com/easy-storage-for-html5-applications.html).

And demo the application here:

Want to create your own todo application?  All you have to do is fork this project and host the pages on a webserver.  Or just use Github pages, which is what I'm doing here.

That is all.
